This repository holds two distinct applications:

1. The **OHIF Viewer**: A general purpose DICOM Viewer ([demo](http://viewer.ohif.org/))
2. **Lesion Tracker**: An oncology-focused imaging application ([demo](http://lesiontracker.ohif.org/))

It also contains several [Meteor Packages](Meteor_Packages) which are used to build both of these applications.

## OHIF Viewer Goals

The Open Health Imaging Foundation intends to provide a simple general purpose DICOM Viewer which can be easily extended for specific uses. The primary purpose of the OHIF Viewer is to serve as a testing ground for the underlying packages and the Cornerstone family of libraries.

## Lesion Tracker

The Lesion Tracker is designed to facilitate quantitative assessments of tumour burden over time. It is similar in scope to the recently released ePAD Imaging Platform (https://epad.stanford.edu/), developed at Stanford Medicine.
